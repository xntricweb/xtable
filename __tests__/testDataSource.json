I reset the trainer by shutting down main power through the disconnect, then turning main power back on, making sure the outdoor and indoor unit where not running in heating or cooling, I pressed the EOSW button with no EM heat or cooling coming on, no indication from the LED lights","","","","","Jim W."],["PID1737","T7130-AAE","L19174-AA","4/16/2021 9:14:28","Jim W.","Test Result","Kelly H.","1","3.792013889","5","5","Initial","None","No issues with the instructions or skills, great job","N/A","No issues with the T7130 the indoor and outdoor units along with the remote and additional components for the trainer functioned according to L19174 AA01","","","","","Jim W."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:38:28","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","12","1.653020833","1","5","Review","None","Not tested, no skills.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:37:28","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","11","1.652326389","5","5","Review","None","Not tested, no skills.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:36:41","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","10","1.651782407","5","5","Review","None","Not tested, no skills","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:35:58","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","9","1.651284722","1","3","Retest","Retest","Not tested, previous review changes not incorporated.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:35:22","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","8","1.650868056","1","3","Retest","Retest","Not tested, previous review changes not incorporated.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:34:48","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","7","1.650474537","1","3","Retest","Retest","Not tested, previous review changes not incorporated.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:34:16","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","6","1.650104167","1","1","Retest","Retest","Not tested, previous review changes not incorporated.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:33:36","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","5","1.649641204","1","3","Review","Review","Not tested, previous review changes not incorporated.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:32:31","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","4","1.648888889","1","3","Review","Review","Not tested, previous review changes not incorporated.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:31:38","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","3","1.648275463","1","3","Review","Review","Not tested, previous review changes not incorporated.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:29:54","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","2","1.647071759","5","5","Review","None","Not tested, no skills.","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/16/2021 8:20:34","Todd L.","Test Result","Jeremy C.","1","1.640590278","5","5","Review","None","No skills","","","","","","","Todd L."],["PID1853","96-CAM1-MAX","LB723-MA","4/15/2021 15:38:38","Jessica K.","Test Request","","D","","","","","","","","","","","D, 3, 4","Supplemental disk: \\\\fszero.ama.net\\distributionSoftware\\SB723-MA00XEN Supplemental CD for 96-CAM1","Brenda M."],["PID1853","96-CAM1-MAX","LB723-MA","4/15/2021 15:38:38","Jessica K.","Test Request","","3","","","","","","","","","","","D, 3, 4","Supplemental disk: \\\\fszero.ama.net\\distributionSoftware\\SB723-MA00XEN Supplemental CD for 96-CAM1","Brenda M."],["PID1853","96-CAM1-MAX","LB723-MA","4/15/2021 15:38:38","Jessica K.","Test Request","","4","","","","","","","","","","","D, 3, 4","Supplemental disk: \\\\fszero.ama.net\\distributionSoftware\\SB723-MA00XEN Supplemental CD for 96-CAM1","Brenda M."],["PID1701","990-PABCL1F","NX40087-AA","4/14/2021 16:58:07","Todd L.","Test Request","","1","","","","","","","","","","","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12","Need Jeremy to retest the PLC VT as his changes should be made and marked on his review sheets.

Throughout the skill  you are instructing the students to take AC Voltage measurements when they need to be DC measurements. Some steps are poorly written and I believe it will cause confusion among users. For example, the students should be instructed of which measurements they are taking before they are instructed to press anything on the outside of the panel. Another example is at one point the student is instructed to continuously press the control power button but they do not need to hold it in.
